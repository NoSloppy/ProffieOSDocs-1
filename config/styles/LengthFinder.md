# Usage
```cpp
LengthFinder&lt;BASE, LIGHTUP&gt;
LengthFinder&lt;&gt;
```

# Arguments
BASE, LIGHTUP: COLOR
Return value: COLOR

# Description
Lights up exactly one led, based on the current color change
variable. When changed, says what the current color change is
so that you know which led is lit up.
Use this when you don't know how many LEDs are in your blade.
Set the blade length to 144, enter color change mode and
change it until no LED turns on, go back one and there you go!
